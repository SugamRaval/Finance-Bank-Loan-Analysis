Data Visualization using Power BI Tool
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY
#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
#### Total Loan Applications: 
- We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
#### Total Funded Amount: 
- Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
#### Total Amount Received: 
- Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
#### Average Interest Rate: 
- Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
#### Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): 
- Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.
#### Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI’s
1. Good Loan:                                                                   
 - Good Loan Application Percentage
 - Good Loan Applications
 - Good Loan Funded Amount
 - Good Loan Total Received Amount
2. Bad Loan:
 - Bad Loan Application Percentage
 - Bad Loan Applications
 - Bad Loan Funded Amount
 - Bad Loan Total Received Amount
#### Loan Status Grid View
- In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.’ By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.
### DASHBOARD 2: OVERVIEW
#### CHARTS
1. <b>Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):</b> To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities
2. <b>Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):</b> To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities
3. <b>Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):</b> To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
4. <b>Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):</b> How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
5. <b>Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):</b> Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
6. <b>Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):</b> For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
7. <b>Metrics to be shown:</b> 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

### DASHBOARD 3: DETAILS
#### GRID
 - Need for a comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.
#### Objective:
 - The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
